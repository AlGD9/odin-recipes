        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Whenever you make breaded and fried chicken, it disappears almost immediately. Try our foolproof three-step 
            method for perfect results every time, then turn it into Chicken Parmesan or serve over salad.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>3 large eggs</em></li>
            <li>Coarse salt</li>
            <li><em>1/3 cup</em> all-purpose flour</li>
            <li><em>3 1/2 cups</em> fresh breadcrumbs</li>
            <li><em>1 cup</em> vegetable oil </li>
            <li><em>8 thin</em> chicken cutlets (about 1 1/2 pounds total) </li>
            <li>Lemon wedges, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a shallow dish, whisk eggs with teaspoon salt; let stand 5 minutes. In another shallow dish, season 
                flour with 1/4 teaspoon salt. In a third shallow dish, season breadcrumbs with 1 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>In a large cast-iron skillet or other heavy deep skillet, heat oil over medium. Meanwhile, pat chicken dry 
                with paper towels. Coat in flour, shaking off excess, then dip in egg (letting excess drip off). Dredge in 
                breadcrumbs, turning twice and patting to adhere.</li>
            <li>Increase heat to medium-high. Working in batches, add chicken to skillet; cook, gently shaking skillet 
                occasionally, until chicken is browned, about 4 minutes. Turn with tongs; cook until browned and opaque 
                throughout, 2 to 3 minutes more (if browning too quickly, lower heat). Between batches, skim off brown 
                crumbs from oil with a slotted spoon. Drain chicken on paper towels; season with salt.</li>
        </ol>
