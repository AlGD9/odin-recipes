        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>If you can boil water, then making pasta carbonara is just a hop, skip, and a jump away. A quick dinner made from 
        six everyday kitchen staples, carbonara is a comfort food standby in Italian kitchens for good reason. As the spaghetti 
        cooks, you'll crisp up some pancetta in a skillet, whisk together eggs and cream on the side, and then toss it all 
        together with and grated Parmesan to create a silky, creamy pasta that is perfect for any day of the week.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><em>1 tablespoon</em> <strong>extra-virgin</strong> olive oil</li>
            <li><em>4 ounces</em> pancetta, guanciale, or bacon, sliced into <em>1/2-inch</em> thick strips</li>
            <li><em>1 large egg</em>, plus <em>3 egg yolks</em></li>
            <li><em>1/4 cup</em> heavy cream</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li><em>1/2 cup</em> grated <strong>Parmigiano-Reggiano</strong> cheese, plus more for serving</li>
            <li><em>1 pound</em> spaghetti</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large skillet, heat oil and pancetta over medium; cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp and browned 
                around edges, 3 to 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to paper towels to drain. In a medium bowl, 
                whisk together egg, yolks, and cream; season lightly with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water 1 minute less than package instructions. 
                Drain, reserving 1 1/2 cups pasta water. Add 1 cup pasta water to skillet; bring to a boil. Add pasta and 
                cook, stirring, until reduced slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
            <li>Slowly add egg mixture to pasta, stirring, until sauce thickens and clings to pasta. Stir in cheese and 
                pancetta; season generously with pepper and serve immediately with more cheese.</li>
